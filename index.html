<p>Quizzer is an application used to help you study for your next test.
Create and edit digital questions and then test yourself using the questions you made.
Quizzer will try to choose topics and questions based upon what kind of questions you appear to be struggling with.</p>

<p>The majority of the questions that I created using Quizzer used images from textbooks and exam papers. Unfortunately I cannot upload questions in fear of Copyright infringement.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Quizzer's development came to a halt after the end of my high school exams, however, Quizzer's source code is now uploaded on GitHub! Feel free to join in on it's development.</p>

<p>I hope to continue it's development in the coming months.</p>

<p>The C# project, 'Quizzer', was a mash-up of code from a VB.NET project (a 'school management system' that I had to write for one of my timed high school assignments) and a separate C# project (a science program called 'MySci' that I wrote for a competition (it won :) )).
All three of these projects were written in my final year and thus, were written with haste as I had to balance my time to code with my time to study. As a result the resulting code is VERY messy: There are bugs to stamp out, code to re-factor, optimizations to be made and lots and lots of unfinished features to be completed. I intend to fix all these myself in time but feel free to help out!</p>
