Unfortunately I cannot upload questions in fear of Copyright infringement.\r\n\r\n# Where did Quizzer come from?\r\nQuizzer was a piece of software developed to help me and a few other students with our final end of year exams.\r\n\r\n# The Development of Quizzer\r\n## What is Quizzer written in?\r\nC#.\r\n## Is Quizzer still in development?\r\nUnfortunately Quizzer's development came to a halt after the end of my high school exams, however, Quizzer's source code is now uploaded on GitHub! Feel free to join in on it's development.\r\n\r\nI hope to continue it's development in the coming months.\r\n###A forewarning to those who are willing to contribute\r\nThe C# project, 'Quizzer', was a mash-up of code from a VB.NET project (a 'school management system' that I had to write for one of my timed high school assignments) and a separate C# project (a science program called 'MySci' that I wrote for a competition (it won :) )).\r\nAll three of these projects were written in my final year and thus, were written with haste as I had to balance my time to code with my time to study. As a result the resulting code is VERY messy: There are bugs to stamp out, code to re-factor, optimizations to be made and lots and lots of unfinished features to be completed. I intend to fix all these myself in time but feel free to help out!\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@RegalUnicorn (Patrick Shaw)","google":"UA-61953651-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
