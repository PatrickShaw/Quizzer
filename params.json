{"name":"Quizzer","tagline":"The open source quizzing application designed to help you with your studies.","body":"# What is Quizzer?\r\nQuizzer is an application used to help you study for your next test.\r\nCreate and edit digital questions and then test yourself using the questions you made.\r\nQuizzer will try to choose topics and questions based upon what kind of questions you appear to be struggling with. \r\n![Question Manager Module](https://github.com/RegalUnicorn/Quizzer/blob/gh-pages/HomePage01.jpg)\r\n![Statistics Page](https://github.com/RegalUnicorn/Quizzer/blob/gh-pages/Statistics01.jpg)\r\n![Quizzing Page](https://github.com/RegalUnicorn/Quizzer/blob/gh-pages/QuestionPage01.jpg)\r\n![Quizzing Page 2](https://github.com/RegalUnicorn/Quizzer/blob/gh-pages/QuestionPage02.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Can you upload a file contain the questions you created manually?\r\nThe majority of the questions that I created using Quizzer used images from textbooks and exam papers. Unfortunately I cannot upload questions in fear of Copyright infringement.\r\n\r\n# Where did Quizzer come from?\r\nQuizzer was a piece of software developed to help me and a few other students with our final end of year exams.\r\n\r\n# The Development of Quizzer\r\n## What is Quizzer written in?\r\nC#.\r\n## Is Quizzer still in development?\r\nUnfortunately Quizzer's development came to a halt after the end of my high school exams, however, Quizzer's source code is now uploaded on GitHub! Feel free to join in on it's development.\r\n\r\nI hope to continue it's development in the coming months.\r\n###A forewarning to those who are willing to contribute\r\nThe C# project, 'Quizzer', was a mash-up of code from a VB.NET project (a 'school management system' that I had to write for one of my timed high school assignments) and a separate C# project (a science program called 'MySci' that I wrote for a competition (it won :) )).\r\nAll three of these projects were written in my final year and thus, were written with haste as I had to balance my time to code with my time to study. As a result the resulting code is VERY messy: There are bugs to stamp out, code to re-factor, optimizations to be made and lots and lots of unfinished features to be completed. I intend to fix all these myself in time but feel free to help out!\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@RegalUnicorn (Patrick Shaw)","google":"UA-61953651-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
